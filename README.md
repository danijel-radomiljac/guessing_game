# Guessing Game

This is a simple guessing game written in Rust. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the number. After each guess, the player is informed whether their guess is too low, too high, or correct.

## About the Project

This project was created by following the "The Rust Programming Language" book, also known as "The Rust Book." It serves as an excellent introduction to Rust and demonstrates fundamental concepts such as input handling, random number generation, and control flow.

## Features

- Generates a random secret number between 1 and 100.
- Provides feedback on whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
- Continuously prompts the user for input until they guess correctly.
